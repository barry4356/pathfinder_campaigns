# Storyline
For more than a hundred years, the demon-infested [Worldwound](locations.md#the-world-wound) has warred against humanity. Along the border of lost Sarkoris, Abyssal armies clash with crusaders, barbarians, and mercenaries, yet the city of [Kenabres](locations.md#kenabres) stands defiant. Demon lords conspire to bring down the last vestiges of resistance, sacrificing legions of servitors. Queen Galfrey has sent out the call: can heroes seal the Worldwound forever?

## Into the World Wound
On the fringes of the wastelands, life goes on. People live in fear of the horrors of the night, but they still proceed with their daily routines, hoping to see the next day. The hopeful place their faith in the crusaders of Iomedae, heroes who patrol the Worldwound in search of any horrific thing that might prey upon the innocent. But on the road to the Worldwound, you won't find a lot of people who trust that things will go well. Maybe you can change that.

### [The Godless Ones](locations/TheGodlessOnes.md#the-godless-ones) :heavy_check_mark:
The Worldwound's demons would not be so confident about their chances of success without allies hidden among the people they prey upon. The demonologist [Sophini](sophini.md#sophini) and several of her Blackfire Adept minions want to bend demons to their will. Show them whose will is strongest.

### [*The Elven Entanglement*](TheElvenEntanglement.md#the-elven-entanglement) :heavy_check_mark:
The road to the Worldwound has pockets of deep forest laden with entanglements. "Uprooter" elves use the twisted forest to their advantage. An eager toad demon has greater ambitions, so the elves and satyrs must seek aid from outsiders.

### *The Wardstone Patrol* :heavy_check_mark:
Crusaders of Iomedae patrol the Worldwound, guarding the magic wardstones that hold Abyssal hordes at bay. As the wardstones begin to crumble, valiant defenders such as the brave Sir Ilivan are the last line of defense. Will they be enough to turn back the demonic hordes?

### *The Traitor's Lodge*
The dark summoner Thurl abandoned his macabre laboratories to ghosts and spectral guardians. Among these warders was the ghostly minotaur Karsos, a onetime servitor of Baphomet. Now Karsos haunts the grisly halls, awaiting foolhardy adventurers with the patience of the dead.
