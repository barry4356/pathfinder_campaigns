# The Elven Entanglement

![map](IntoTheWorldwound.png)

After defeating Sophini and her demon cult, our Fellowship of adventurers gather their new allies and loot, deciding to answer the call of Queen Galfrey and travel to the city of Kenabres (where there will surely be even more loot).

While common wisdom is to avoid the Estrovian Forest, the adventurers believe their dwarven ranger more than capable of navigating the twisted woods. Upon entering the woods, the adventurers meet an uprooter elf who asks for their help; The toad demon Fihralaz has captured the Satyr Vinst, and has begun spreading havoc accross the wilderness. Can our adventurers remove this taint from the forest?

## Rewards

Each character draws a random weapon or spell from the box.

## Notes
- One player can add the cohort Cecilla the Uprooter
to their hand on their first turn.
- Players have the option to skip their free exploration
on their turn and to fight the fiendish tree instead.
If they succeed they can draw the cohort Vinst from the box.
- There is an official typo/reprint on the Vinst card
that allows ANYONE (not just the player holding the card)
to use him to skip a location closing check
- Any cards encountered that have an animal trait 
are instead replaced with a carnivorous stump.
- There are multiple Tangle Trap henchmen in the scenario.
The check to defeat these traps is not a combat check,
so the only weapons that help are ones with a "slashing" trait.
