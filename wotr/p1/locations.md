Avistan is a peninsular continent which branches off the main mass of Casmaron west of the World's Edge Mountains. The landmass stretches from the Inner Sea in the south to the glaciers of the Crown of the World in the north and possesses as many varied environments as any other continent on Golarion. Dozens of nations now exist on the continent, from infernal Cheliax to the ancient kingdom of Taldor to the elven forests of Kyonin, but the land also holds an ancient history. Perhaps the greatest of the fallen nations of Avistan is that of the Thassilonian Empire, which crumbled into ruin at the time of the Earthfall.

A demon-haunted wasteland that lies at the northern most reaches of Avistan where it meets the frozen Crown of the World, the Worldwound is an unnatural blight. Formed shortly after the beginning of the Age of Lost Omens the Worldwound is probably the greatest threat to life on the face of Golarion.

## Kenabres

Kenabres is a fortified crusader city bordering the Worldwound. Currently, the city is the center of a radical faction of Iomedae's faith who are renowned witch-hunters, led by the aging Hulrun Shappok. Although the city has become infamous for its witch hunts to ferret out any demonic influence in the population, the recently instituted Order of Heralds has made great strides in curbing the worst of these inquisitions. Many hope that they will dissipate entirely with the death of Hulrun, the elderly leader of the inquisition. The crusader generals of the city, Dyre and Marcovina, constantly fight with Hulrun over the allocation of the city's soldiers: Hulrun insists that they should be hunting internal enemies, while the generals argue that they are needed on the western front
