# The Elven Entanglement

![map](IntoTheWorldwound.png)

After defeating Sophini and her demon cult, our Fellowship of adventurers gather their new allies and loot, deciding to answer the call of Queen Galfrey and travel to the city of [Kenabres](locations.md#kenabres) (where there will surely be even more loot).

While common wisdom is to avoid the Estrovian Forest, the adventurers believe their dwarven ranger more than capable of navigating the twisted woods. Upon entering the woods, the adventurers meet an uprooter elf who asks for their help; The toad demon Fihralaz has captured the Satyr Vinst, and has begun spreading havoc accross the wilderness. Can our adventurers remove this taint from the forest?

While searching for the demon Fihralaz, our heroes decide once again to split up and search the area. The Uprooter Elf Cecilla joined the necromancer in searching the dark forest. The fearless inquisitor rescued Vinst, and assaulted the corrupted guardpost. Dozens of undead corrupted soldiers were mutilated in the assault. Harsk decided to scout through the wounded lands, while Felix scouted through the cemetery. It was Felix who initially flushed the toad demon out of hiding. Despite the terror his presence caused in the forrest, Fihralaz proved to be a less-than-worthy adversary. The demon barely managed to escape into the forrest. The other adventurers quickly rushed to Felix's aid, and were able to corner the toad demon and destroy him. Cecilla promised her aid if ever the adventurers needed it, and the fellowship continued their journey through the forrest, towards Kenabres...

## Rewards

Each character draws a random weapon or spell from the box.

## Notes
- One player can add the cohort Cecilla the Uprooter
to their hand on their first turn.
- Players have the option to skip their free exploration
on their turn and to fight the fiendish tree instead.
If they succeed they can draw the cohort Vinst from the box.
- There is an official typo/reprint on the Vinst card
that allows ANYONE (not just the player holding the card)
to use him to skip a location closing check
- Any cards encountered that have an animal trait 
are instead replaced with a carnivorous stump.
- There are multiple Tangle Trap henchmen in the scenario.
The check to defeat these traps is not a combat check,
so the only weapons that help are ones with a "slashing" trait.
