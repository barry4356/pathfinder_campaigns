The power of the dead courses through Darago’s thin veins. It’s a rare wizard who can traffic
with the unliving and retain most of his soul, but so far, Darago has resisted the baser desires
of most necromancers. Still, his chilling voice and devilish sense of humor will surprise even
the most hardened adventurers. After all, he will happily battle at the side of any adventurer
while she lives… and perhaps for a short time thereafter.

Harsk has always been an unusual sort of dwarf, preferring open skies to cramped underground
halls, the flexibility of a crossbow to the sturdiness of an axe, and tea to ale—it keeps his senses
sharp. A gruff and driven dwarf, he left his home to fulfill a vow of justice to avenge his brother’s
death at the hands of raiding giants. He has since learned much of the world, its lands, its beasts,
and its vast array of people and places worth protecting.
